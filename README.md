<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- Add Bet types to model.py
  - Add [place bets](https://www.liveabout.com/craps-place-bets-537453)
  - Add [side bets](https://wizardofodds.com/games/craps/appendix/5/)
    - Add the [Yo](https://www.lolcraps.com/craps/bets/yo/) first. That's fun.
- Strategy constructor / builder
  - Logic layer to facilitate strategy construction in a low code environment. For example:
    - `IF` the game puck is off `AND` I do not have a place bet, `THEN` make a place bet.
    - `IF` the game puck is on `AND` I do <u>not</u> have odds on a place or come bet, `THEN` put f(x) odds on it.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/mhegarty/craps/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
